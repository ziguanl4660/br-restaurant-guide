# Bay Ridge Restaurant Guide
## Directions

#### The purpose of this activity is to help students practice linking files, doing so collaboratively by practicing merging.

Click [here](home.md) to begin!

## Task 0: Study the directory structure

1. Observe the files that are in the root directory of this repository:  
  a. `README.md` is these directions  
  b. `home.md` is where the user begins
2. Explore the folders and the files inside of them.

---

## Task 1: Getting Started

1. Partner up. One person needs to fork this repo and add the other partner as a collaborator. The collaborator needs to open their email to accept the invitation.  
2. You both need to clone the forked repo into `~/wd/classwork/`. 

This will be the workflow for most _(but not all)_ pair activities. `Git` used to it!

## Task 2: 

1. Notice that the **American** section is completely finished.  All links direct the user to the appropriate file/website.  
  a. _**IMPORTANT**: the links only work when viewed on GitHub (if you try clicking them in your IDE preview, you will likely get a_ `404 Not Found` _error)._ So `push` to Github to test out the links!
2. Your task  is to update the links for the entire **Asian** section.  The restaurants are divided into sub-categories of Asian food.

NOTE: You are doing this collaboratively!  Split up the work, add/commit/push, and pull & resolve conflicts when necessary.  This activity serves two purposes: **practice linking files** and **practice collaboration**.

---

## Task 3:

1. Add a new food category: **European**.  It should have a sub-category structure, just like **Asian** did:  


* Greek  
  * Omonia Cafe  
  * Something Greek  
* Mediterranean  
  * Tanoreen  
  * The Family Store  
  
Like **Task 2**: divide & conquer, push and pull.

## Task 4: Extension

Add your own section(s)! 

You do not need to finish this. But if you finish Tasks 1-3 in class, start this task!
